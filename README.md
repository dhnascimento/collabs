## Last.fm API Exploratory Data Analysis

The main objectives of this repository are: to explore the Last.fm API features and functionalities,  extract the available information from it, get insights from the data and visualizations in Python.

We followed this [Dataquest tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/last-fm-api-python/) to learn about how the API works and made some changes in the code to get data from Last.fm users instead of overall data available from all the artists.
